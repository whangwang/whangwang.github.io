<ul>
<li><b>Simply set a data attribute on desired images and the plugin will apply the image's dominant color to it's parent element's background.</b></li>
<li><b>Caveat:</b> Doesn't work with remote images if the respective server has CORS disabled, ie. it won't work with Flickr URLs...</li>
<li><b>Credit</b>: Heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/briangonzalez/jquery.adaptive-backgrounds.js">jquery.adaptive-backgrounds.js</a> - basically, it's the jQuery free version.</li>
<li>Browser support: IE9+</li>
</ul>
